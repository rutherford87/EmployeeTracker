# EmployeeTracker

This is a command line interface that tracks employees and their department.

Contents of repo:
* index.json
* schema.sql
* README.md

Requirements:  
Before running this application, "npm i" for the package.json to install: inquirer, console.table, mysql.

This is an MVP of how to initiate tables, make a connection through node and mysql, and CRUD values to mysql through CL.

This was challenging but enjoyable. 

Good luck, have fun!
